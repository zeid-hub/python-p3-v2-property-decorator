# Property Function Decorator

## Learning Goals

- Use property() as a Decorator

---

## Key Vocab

- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Property**: attributes that are controlled by methods.
- **Decorator**: function that takes another function as an argument and returns
  a new function with added functionality.

## Introduction

Properties in Python are attributes that are controlled by methods. We've
already seen how to use the `property()` function to define getter and setter
methods that control how object attributes are accessed and modified.

A **decorator** is a function that takes another function as an argument and
returns a new function, often attaching pre- or post-processing functionality.
The decorator syntax was not available when the property() function was
originally introduced. However, the decorator syntax was added in Python 2.4,
and using property() as a decorator has become a popular practice.

## Reviewing `property()`

Before we see how to use a decorator to define a property, let's review the
original `property()` function.

We'll start with a `Dog` class with attributes for `name` and `breed`.

- `name` must be a string of 1 to 25 characters in length
- `breed` must be a string in the list of approved breeds

We define getter and setter methods for the attributes, then use the `property`
function to enforce that the methods are used to access and mutate the
attributes:

```py
APPROVED_BREEDS = [
    "Mastiff",
    "Chihuahua",
    "Corgi",
    "Shar Pei",
    "Beagle",
    "French Bulldog",
    "Pug",
    "Pointer"
]


class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name='Fido', breed='Mastiff'):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def get_name(self):
        return self._name

    def set_name(self, name):
        if isinstance(name, str) and 1 <= len(name) <= 25:
            self._name = name.title()
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Name must be string between 1 and 25 characters.")

    name = property(get_name, set_name)

    def get_breed(self):
        return self._breed

    def set_breed(self, breed):
        if breed in APPROVED_BREEDS:
            self._breed = breed
        else:
            raise ValueError("Breed must be in list of approved breeds.")

    breed = property(get_breed, set_breed)

```

If we create a Dog with a valid name and breed, no exception is thrown :

```py
Dog("Fido", "Corgi")
```

However, passing a name that is not a string results in a `ValueError`
exception:

```py
Dog(7, "Pug")

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/python-p3-v2-property-decorator/lib/dog.py", line 15, in __init__
    self.name = name
  File "/python-p3-v2-property-decorator/lib/dog.py", line 25, in set_name
    raise ValueError(
ValueError: Name must be string between 1 and 25 characters.

```

A name with an invalid length also throws the exception:

```py
Dog("Fido the Pug who likes to roll in the mud", "Pug")

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/python-p3-v2-property-decorator/lib/dog.py", line 15, in __init__
    self.name = name
  File "/python-p3-v2-property-decorator/lib/dog.py", line 25, in set_name
    raise ValueError(
ValueError: Name must be string between 1 and 25 characters.

```

An exception is thrown if the breed is not in the approved list:

```py
>>> Dog("Fifi", "Poodle")

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/python-p3-v2-property-decorator/lib/dog.py", line 16, in __init__
    self.breed = breed
  File "/python-p3-v2-property-decorator/lib/dog.py", line 37, in set_breed
    raise ValueError("Breed must be in list of approved breeds.")
ValueError: Breed must be in list of approved breeds.

```

  <p>Yes, the assignment <br> <code>dog.breed = "Beagle, Blue Tick"</code> <br>throws a <code>ValueError</code> exception since the breed is not in the approved list.</p>

This lesson is a code-along, so fork and clone the repo.

**NOTE: Remember to run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and
`pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment before running your code.**

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

This code-along lesson contains a file `dog_property_test.py` for testing the
`Dog` class and its properties.

```py
from dog import Dog
import pytest


class TestDogProperties:
    '''Class Dog in dog.py'''

    def test_name_breed_valid(self):
        '''validates name and breed properties are initialized with valid values'''
        try:
            # No exception should be thrown since name and breed are valid
            dog = Dog("Fido", "Corgi")
        except Exception as exc:
            # The assertion fails if an exception is thrown
            assert False, f'Dog("Fido", "Corgi") raised an exception {exc}'

    def test_name_is_string_valid_length(self):
        '''validates name property is assigned a string between 1 and 25 characters'''
        dog = Dog("Fido", "Corgi")
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            dog.name = 7  # not a string
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            dog.name = ''  # too short
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            dog.name = 'Fido the adorable Corgi who likes to steal socks'  # too long

    def test_breed_is_approved_breed(self):
        '''validates breed property is in list of approved choices'''
        dog = Dog("Snoopy", "Beagle")
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            dog.breed = "Poodle"  # not an approved breed
```

Let's run the tests to confirm the current implementation of the `name` and
`breed` properties. The tests should pass.

```bash
pytest -x
```

## Using property() as a decorator

We decorate a function by placing the name of the decorator with a leading @
symbol before the definition of the function you want to decorate:

```py
@decorator
def func(a):
    return a
```

This syntax is equivalent to the following:

```py
def func(a):
    return a

func = decorator(func)
```

We use the `@property` decorator to define a property's getter function. The
method should use the public name for the underlying managed attribute, for
example `name`.

```py
@property
def name(self):
    """The name property"""
    return self._name
```

We define the setter method as shown, using the decorator `@name.setter` rather
than `@property`:

```py
@name.setter
def name(self, name):
    """Name must be a string between 1 and 25 characters in length"""
    if isinstance(name, str) and 1 <= len(name) <= 25:
            self._name = name
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Name must be string between 1 and 25 characters."
            )
```

We'll define the `breed` property in a similar manner. The final version of the
`Dog` class is as shown:

```py
APPROVED_BREEDS = [
    "Mastiff",
    "Chihuahua",
    "Corgi",
    "Shar Pei",
    "Beagle",
    "French Bulldog",
    "Pug",
    "Pointer"
]


class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name='Fido', breed='Mastiff'):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    @property
    def name(self):
        """The name property"""
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, name):
        """Name must be a string between 1 and 25 characters in length"""
        if isinstance(name, str) and 1 <= len(name) <= 25:
            self._name = name
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Name must be string between 1 and 25 characters."
            )

    @property
    def breed(self):
        """The breed property"""
        return self._breed

    @breed.setter
    def breed(self, breed):
        """Breed must be in the list of approved breeds"""
        if breed in APPROVED_BREEDS:
            self._breed = breed
        else:
            raise ValueError("Breed must be in list of approved breeds.")
```

Notice this implementation is more Pythonic. The method names match the
attributes `name` and `breed`, and the decorators clearly indicate the purpose
of each method.

Run the tests to confirm the updated class implementation works.

```bash
pytest -x
```

If we need methods for deleting the properties, we would decorate the methods
with `@name.deleter` and `@breed.deleter`.

## Conclusion

Let's summarize the important points when creating properties with the decorator
approach:

- The `@property` decorator must decorate the getter method.
- The docstring must go in the getter method.
- The setter and deleter methods must be decorated with the name of the getter
  method plus `.setter` and `.deleter`, respectively.
